Spring isn’t necessarily the best time for you to sell your home. Here are three additional factors to consider.


Here’s a question that I get a lot: Now that it’s winter, when is the best time to sell my house? Here
are three thoughts for you that will help answer the question:

1. The spring has a lot more activity. There are more houses for sale in the spring, as well as
more buyers. However, it doesn’t necessarily mean higher prices for you. Winter sales have a lot
fewer houses, but still a steady supply of buyers. From what I’ve seen, winter sales tend to bring
a little bit more money if you get in at the right time.

2. The market cycle. The market is cyclical, but we’re probably at the peak right now. We never
know when the cycle starts or ends.

3. When should you buy and/or sell? Whenever is most convenient for you. Interest rates are
still amazingly low and we’ve sold three listings this week for over their asking price.

If you have any questions for us about buying, selling, or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate
to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
