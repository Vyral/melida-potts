What is the right price for your home, and what is a fair commission? We’ll discuss both questions today.

Many sellers come to me saying that they want to find an agent who will help them sell their home for a high price at a low commission. Obviously, no one wants to sell their home for a low price and pay a high commission!

Here’s the issue, though: An agent or company that is willing to put homes on the market for low commission at any price doesn’t really intend to sell your property; they’re using it as bait to attract buyers so they can then sell them something else. The longer your home is on the market with them, the better off they are.

It’s a far smarter decision to put your home on the market at the right price as determined by comparable sales and at a fair commission to the agent.

If you’re wondering what is the right price for your home or what a fair commission rate is, reach out to me. I’d be glad to give you an honest answer about the value of your home and the commission rate I tend to charge. I hope to hear from you soon!
