*According to the latest numbers, it’s a great time to sell in North Atlanta.*

What are the latest numbers from our North Atlanta real estate market?

As of the recording of this video, there are 10,391 homes for sale, which sounds like a lot, but we’ve actually seen a higher number than this before.&nbsp;

{% include pullquote.html %}

In the last 30 days, 2,744 homes have sold, which means 21% of all listed homes are selling. That doesn’t sound like a lot, but it is. It also means we have a 4.8-month supply of homes. In other words, it would take buyers almost five months to buy all available homes if nothing else came on the market. Of course, as spring brings warmer weather, more buyers will enter the market.&nbsp;

**So is it a good time to sell? No, it’s not a good time to sell…it’s a *great* time.**

If you’re considering selling and wondering what your home is worth, don’t hesitate to give me a call. I’d love to help.
