You know you live in Atlanta when….
Friends, Clients, and Fellow ATLiens:

Today I’d like to take a break from real estate to talk about something only us Atlantans will understand.

Whether you’re an Atlanta native or a transplant to the city, you know the A is one of a kind. But, between us ATLiens, not everything about living here is so “peachy.”

By now, you’ve probably figured out that I’m talking about our traffic. Because, let’s be honest: If there’s anything Atlantans love to hate, it’s the fact that rush “hour” lasts all day—nevermind the fact that stop signs are basically just suggestions.

Between this and the fact that a single raindrop can induce city-wide panic, driving even just a few blocks can take all afternoon. It’s no wonder so many people like to say that Atlanta is just an hour-long drive from Atlanta.

But no matter how much taking the interstate, the highway, or Peachtree (the only real three options around here) drives you crazy, you do it anyway because the only thing worse than driving in Atlanta is taking public transport in Atlanta.

The good news is that our traffic gives us a lot of extra free time to think—even if most of that thinking is about how to get away with vehicular homicide.

It’s truly amazing how fast Southern Hospitality goes out the window when ATLiens get behind the wheel—almost as fast as we could all be driving if we lived somewhere else.

As much as we complain, though, we know that our apocalypse-level traffic is a small price to pay for living in the slice of Heaven that is Atlanta. And, as your local ATLien Realtor, I’m always here for you, whether you’re looking to buy or sell a home or just to talk about the latest bridge collapse. After all, if there’s anything we spend more time doing than sitting in traffic, it’s talking about Atlanta traffic.

Speaking of which: What Atlanta traffic stories do you have? I’d love to hear about them; so reach out anytime. And as always, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email for any of your real estate needs. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Your friend,

Melida Potts
