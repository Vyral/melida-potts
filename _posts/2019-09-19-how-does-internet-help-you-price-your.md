How does the internet help you price your home? Find out today.

I’m often asked by clients how the internet can help them price their home. This also begs the question of what a good pricing strategy looks like.

The internet today has all of the information you could possibly want. In fact, you might say there’s an overabundance of information. What’s the trick to sorting through all of it to find the right information you need?

Well, you could check tax records, which will tell you that your home could be priced within a certain range. However, I’ve seen homes priced in that range that didn’t sell. I’ve seen homes priced higher than that range that have sold. I’ve also seen homes that were priced under that range and have yet to sell. The trick is to find the most relevant information to your case.

So what conclusions can be drawn from the information?

In the end, if you’re simply curious about your home’s value, basic online information works fine. But if you’re seriously looking to sell your home and want to know it's worth, reach out to me. I’d be glad to give you an accurate measure of your home’s value so that we can price it to sell quickly and for the most money possible. I hope to hear from you soon!

I would love to tell you that it’s easy to establish the price of your own home. But the reality is that you can’t—not because you’re not smart enough, but because there is so much information to sort through on your own.
