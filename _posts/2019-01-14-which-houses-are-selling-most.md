To answer the question of which homes are selling the most, we first need to look at who’s buying.

Millennials now make up 45% of homebuyers. This means entry-level homes are moving quickly.
If your home falls in a category that millennials can afford, you’ll find yourself in the perfect market
when you decide to sell.

Generation Xers make up 37% of buyers, and they’re buying in the $400,000 to $500,000 range.

Baby boomers are still 17% of the homebuyers in our market—this generation has the most money,
but the high-end price range tends to be slow because there is such a small percentage of
these buyers.

If you’re looking to buy or sell, need more information, or have any questions, feel free to reach out
to us. We look forward to hearing from you.
