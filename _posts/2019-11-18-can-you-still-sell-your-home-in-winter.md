You missed the chance to sell in the spring and summer markets, but is it too late to sell in the winter? Find out today.

If you missed your shot at selling your home in the spring and summer markets, can you still sell in the winter? Here’s what the numbers say:

This time of year, we do have a lot fewer homes for sale. I don’t have a crystal ball for this coming winter, but in the past, we’ve had up to 50% fewer homes on the market in the winter than in other seasons. This means you’ll have less competition from other sellers, so maybe that’s a good reason to consider selling in the fall/winter. There are also fewer buyers this time of year, but only between 10% and 15% fewer.

So, you do the math: If there are half as many homes in the winter market than in other times of the year and only 15% fewer buyers, do you think the winter market is a good time to sell? I absolutely do! Interest rates are still down and the buyers are out there.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
