The numbers tell us that our market is slowing down, but they don’t tell the whole story.

What’s going on in our North Atlanta real estate market? Let’s look at a few year-over-year statistics
from this last quarter.

• The number of home sales at the beginning of this year was down 8%—however, the ratio of homes that are actually selling versus what’s currently on the market is looking great
• The average sales price rose from $281,000 to $298,000
• The number of units for sale rose from roughly 27,000 to roughly 28,000

These numbers tell us that the market is slowing down a little, but in my experience, 2019
gave us the best we’ve had in the past 15 years. Homes are selling
quickly and at decent prices.

If you have any more questions about our market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a
home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
