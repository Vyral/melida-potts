Has the Atlanta market slowed down? Find out what’s going on right here.

Today’s topic has been on a lot of people’s minds: Has the Atlanta market slowed down? Today, I’ll
share what the numbers have to say:

1. The number of sales is down, even for the season.
2. However, home prices are still up.
3. The supply of inventory is still the same.

Typically, for the market to have slowed, there must have been fewer sales, with prices having
dropped and supply having risen. So in the end, our market might have slowed down, but not
enough to hinder your real estate plans. If you’re thinking of selling a house, now is still a great
time to do so!

For an individual analysis of your own property, or if you have any questions, please feel free to reach
out to me. I’d love to hear from you.
