Can you sell your home through the internet? Today I’ll explore this question.

This question is asked fairly frequently, and my answer is yes! We already use the internet to
sell homes. Your real estate expert should be marketing your home through various online platforms.

However, when people ask me that question, they often mean something a little different—they’re
really trying to ask, “Can I sell my home through the internet and pay a lower commission?”

Well, when it comes to online purchases, we tend to buy low-priced items sight unseen. On the
other hand, we don’t often make high-priced purchases online without seeing what we’re buying first.

If you bought a 70-inch T.V. online but didn’t like it when you received it, you could always send
it back. Even if you’re looking to purchase a car online, you can always have the owner drive
over so you can inspect if before making a decision. A house, however, is a little more difficult to
drive, so you’d have to go out to the home yourself to take a look.

So, can you sell your home through the internet? Yes; it’s already happening. Should you expect
someone to buy your home online sight unseen? I don’t think that’s going to happen
anytime soon.

If you have any questions about our internet savviness or which websites we use to market
homes, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.
