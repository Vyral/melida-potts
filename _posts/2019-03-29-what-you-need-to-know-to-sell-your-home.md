If you’re looking to sell your home this spring, there are a few things you need to know about the spring selling season.

Spring is a great time to sell your home, but it’s not without its share of drawbacks that you need to be
aware of. There are three, in particular, you should know before starting the home sale
process:

1. It’s more competitive. There are a lot more homes on the market, so the earlier you can list
yours, the better.

2. There are more buyers out and about, which means you’ll have more showings to deal with.

3. It takes a little more work to sell in the spring—both inside the home and outside. On the
outside, people will be looking at your front yard more than they would be in the fall, winter, or
even summer. Inside the home, you need to open up your space and reflect the change of season.

If you have any questions or you need help selling your home this spring, don’t hesitate to reach
out to me. I’d love to help you.
