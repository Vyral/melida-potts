<h3 class="post-title entry-title" itemprop="name"><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;">&nbsp;</span></h3><h3 class="post-title entry-title" itemprop="name"><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;">You  have probably heard over and over again lately about the phenomenal  buying market out there for property enthusiasts. In fact, even if you  are not a bona fide investor it is still a great time to get into the  business of investing in property. One of the reasons for this ripe  environment to invest and actually make significant amounts of money on  that investment is the low costs of obtaining property that we are  seeing today.</span></h3><div class="post-header"> </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-outline-level: 1;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;">Today’s Low, Low Cost of Financing</span></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;">Not only are </span><a href="http://www.standardandpoors.com/indices/sp-case-shiller-home-price-indices/en/us/?indexId=spusa-cashpidff--p-us----"><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;">homes priced lower</span></a><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;"> but also the actual cost to borrow money to purchase the homes is also  lower. Not too many years ago the cost of a mortgage was as high as many  credit cards are today and when you compound that into 30-year fixed  mortgages, the finance charges become astronomical. With today’s  interest rates, however, monthly payments for the same house you might  have purchased at the old interest rates are much lower. </span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-h_-x0lxs3xk/T6gZuZuj8LI/AAAAAAAAHro/LI3f1fVdBh4/s1600/comparative-market-analysis.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="124" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-h_-x0lxs3xk/T6gZuZuj8LI/AAAAAAAAHro/LI3f1fVdBh4/s200/comparative-market-analysis.jpg" width="200" /></a></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;">Let’s  look at a $200,000 home. If you financed it back in the 80s when rates  were as high as 16% (or more) the total monthly payment amount would be  about $2,900. Factor in today’s record-setting interest rates and the  monthly payment is more than fifty percent less at around $1,200. This  is for the same house!</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-outline-level: 1;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;">Home Prices Remain Very Low</span></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;">After the infamous </span><a href="http://www.investopedia.com/features/crashes/crashes9.asp"><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;">market crash of 2007</span></a><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;">,  housing prices plummeted and they have remained at or near bottom for  quite some time now. For buyers and investors this translates to one of  the best opportunities – especially when combining low home prices with  record low interest rates. Not only is the home affordable, but so is  the cost to borrow money to buy it. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;">Consider  the example above of the $200,000 home. If your budget is $200,000 and  you were not buying in today’s market – how much home would you be able  to afford within that amount?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Of  course, what you would be able to get will depend on location,  neighborhood, style of home and other factors. But in general, the  amount of house you would be able to afford ten years ago does not even  compare to what you can get today for the same amount of money.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-outline-level: 1;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;">Invest for Pennies on the Dollar Now – Enjoy Sizable Returns Later</span></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;">When billionaire investor Warren Buffett was recently asked about the best investment sectors of today he </span><a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/46538421/Warren_Buffett_on_CNBC_I_d_Buy_Up_A_Couple_Hundred_Thousand_Single_Family_Homes_If_I_Could"><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;">suggested investing in single-family homes</span></a><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;"> on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage. This advice came in light of current  market conditions that end up in pennies on the dollar investment  schemes. Buying a home today for under $200,000 will easily yield more  than double the returns by the time the mortgage is paid off. Many savvy  homeowners today are also making extra payments to shorten the term  length of their mortgages. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VGXCVoacLGA/T6gZuOGK_oI/AAAAAAAAHrg/WUpOr_6cOCw/s1600/23151fp8etfw48f.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="132" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VGXCVoacLGA/T6gZuOGK_oI/AAAAAAAAHrg/WUpOr_6cOCw/s200/23151fp8etfw48f.jpg" width="200" /></a><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;">With  the plethora of investors and buyers that are delving into the property  market to seize the opportunities out there, many have been turning to  any means possible to come up with the down payments. Whether dipping  into savings, obtaining a home equity line of credit on an existing  home, converting the purchased home into a rental property – buyers are  getting creative.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi;">If  you would like to explore your options and find out how you can take  advantage of the amazing investment opportunities right now, contact us  today.
