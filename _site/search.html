Find out today.If you missed your shot at selling your home in the spring and summer markets, can you still sell in the winter? Here’s what the numbers say:This time of year, we do have a lot fewer homes for sale. I don’t have a crystal ball for this coming winter, but in the past, we’ve had up to 50% fewer homes on the market in the winter than in other seasons. This means you’ll have less competition from other sellers, so maybe that’s a good reason to consider selling in the fall/winter. There are also fewer buyers this time of year, but only between 10% and 15% fewer.“IN THE PAST, WE’VE HAD UP TO 50% FEWER HOMES ON THE MARKET IN THE WINTER.”So, you do the math: If there are half as many homes in the winter market than in other times of the year and only 15% fewer buyers, do you think the winter market is a good time to sell? I absolutely do! Interest rates are still down and the buyers are out there.If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.",

        "content": "You know you live in Atlanta when….Friends, Clients, and Fellow ATLiens:Today I’d like to take a break from real estate to talk about something only us Atlantans will understand.Whether you’re an Atlanta native or a transplant to the city, you know the A is one of a kind. But, between us ATLiens, not everything about living here is so “peachy.”By now, you’ve probably figured out that I’m talking about our traffic. Because, let’s be honest: If there’s anything Atlantans love to hate, it’s the fact that rush “hour” lasts all day—nevermind the fact that stop signs are basically just suggestions.Between this and the fact that a single raindrop can induce city-wide panic, driving even just a few blocks can take all afternoon. It’s no wonder so many people like to say that Atlanta is just an hour-long drive from Atlanta.But no matter how much taking the interstate, the highway, or Peachtree (the only real three options around here) drives you crazy, you do it anyway because the only thing worse than driving in Atlanta is taking public transport in Atlanta.The good news is that our traffic gives us a lot of extra free time to think—even if most of that thinking is about how to get away with vehicular homicide.It’s truly amazing how fast Southern Hospitality goes out the window when ATLiens get behind the wheel—almost as fast as we could all be driving if we lived somewhere else.As much as we complain, though, we know that our apocalypse-level traffic is a small price to pay for living in the slice of Heaven that is Atlanta. And, as your local ATLien Realtor, I’m always here for you, whether you’re looking to buy or sell a home or just to talk about the latest bridge collapse. After all, if there’s anything we spend more time doing than sitting in traffic, it’s talking about Atlanta traffic.Speaking of which: What Atlanta traffic stories do you have? I’d love to hear about them; so reach out anytime. And as always, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email for any of your real estate needs. I look forward to hearing from you soon.Your friend,Melida Potts",

        "content": "What is the right price for your home, and what is a fair commission? We’ll discuss both questions today.Many sellers come to me saying that they want to find an agent who will help them sell their home for a high price at a low commission. Obviously, no one wants to sell their home for a low price and pay a high commission!Here’s the issue, though: An agent or company that is willing to put homes on the market for low commission at any price doesn’t really intend to sell your property; they’re using it as bait to attract buyers so they can then sell them something else. The longer your home is on the market with them, the better off they are.It’s a far smarter decision to put your home on the market at the right price as determined by comparable sales and at a fair commission to the agent.If you’re wondering what is the right price for your home or what a fair commission rate is, reach out to me. I’d be glad to give you an honest answer about the value of your home and the commission rate I tend to charge. I hope to hear from you soon!",

        "content": "How does the internet help you price your home? Find out today.I’m often asked by clients how the internet can help them price their home. This also begs the question of what a good pricing strategy looks like.The internet today has all of the information you could possibly want. In fact, you might say there’s an overabundance of information. What’s the trick to sorting through all of it to find the right information you need?Well, you could check tax records, which will tell you that your home could be priced within a certain range. However, I’ve seen homes priced in that range that didn’t sell. I’ve seen homes priced higher than that range that have sold. I’ve also seen homes that were priced under that range and have yet to sell. The trick is to find the most relevant information to your case.“If you’re simply curious about your home’s value, basic online information works fine.”So what conclusions can be drawn from the information?In the end, if you’re simply curious about your home’s value, basic online information works fine. But if you’re seriously looking to sell your home and want to know it’s worth, reach out to me. I’d be glad to give you an accurate measure of your home’s value so that we can price it to sell quickly and for the most money possible. I hope to hear from you soon!I would love to tell you that it’s easy to establish the price of your own home. But the reality is that you can’t—not because you’re not smart enough, but because there is so much information to sort through on your own.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "If you’re thinking about buying a brand-new home, I’ve got some great advice for you today. Here’s what you need to know about your options.If you’re debating whether or not you should buy a new construction home, I’ve got some advice to share with you today about the two options you’ll have to decide between.One option is to buy your own land and hire your own builder to build the house you really want. You’ll end up with exactly what you want, but there are some things you should be cautious about. For example, the things you want now may not be the things you want in five years, and you’ll be stuck with them. Also, building a fully custom home can affect your resale value because the more unique a home is, the fewer the number of buyers who’ll be interested in it. If you build something that’s somewhat unusual, you’ll have a narrower market of buyers.“Buying a home that’s already under construction will result in significant savings.”The second option is to find a subdivision that’s already in development with a builder who’s already building and buy one of those. Buying one of these homes will result in significant savings for you. Most of the time, builders pass on their bulk building costs to the buyer. This option is less expensive per square foot. Builders have also studied the floor plans that people like and that will increase your resale value moving forward. Personally, this is the option I would go with if I wanted to buy a brand-new home.Either one of these options is great, but you need to decide for yourself what’s important to you in a home. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "Pricing a home is tricky, but does it make more sense to price the home for more or less than its worth? The answer may surprise you.If you’re a home seller, you might be wondering whether it’s better to overprice or underprice your home. Of course, neither is better. The best strategy is to price it just right. However, sometimes the market isn’t very clear and we end up doing one or the other.I would say that it’s probably more dangerous to overprice because it will result in the house accumulating market time and no offers. You won’t get your home sold. If the market is going up, that’s not a big deal. If the market is flat or moving down, it’s a real big issue.“Underpricing is an easier mistake to deal with.”Underpricing is probably an easier mistake to live with. When we underprice, it’s likely that you’ll have multiple buyers because it’s a good deal. That will result in the market bringing the price back up to where it needs to be.You should definitely be more afraid of overpricing, but we always strive to price just right. If you have any questions for me about pricing or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

If your home is above that range, the cost to bring your home up to selling condition will be high.“If your house is under the $250,000 price range, you may be able to make a good investment by renting your property.”Why would you want to rent instead of sell? Is it the income? Is it the ability to cover certain expenses because you don’t want to take a loss on the sale of your home? Your answers to those questions need to align with your long-term goals.What is the best option for you? Depending on the price of your home, you’re often way better off selling your home, especially if it’s more than 2,000 square feet or if it’s above the $250,000 price range.If you think the numbers I gave are arbitrary, or if you have any questions, feel free to give me a call. I’d love to talk about this with you in more detail.",

Today, I’llshare what the numbers have to say:  The number of sales is down, even for the season.  However, home prices are still up.  The supply of inventory is still the same.Typically, for the market to have slowed, there must have been fewer sales, with prices havingdropped and supply having risen. So in the end, our market might have slowed down, but notenough to hinder your real estate plans.

We already use the internet tosell homes. Your real estate expert should be marketing your home through various online platforms.However, when people ask me that question, they often mean something a little different—they’rereally trying to ask, “Can I sell my home through the internet and pay a lower commission?”Well, when it comes to online purchases, we tend to buy low-priced items sight unseen. On theother hand, we don’t often make high-priced purchases online without seeing what we’re buying first.If you bought a 70-inch T.V. online but didn’t like it when you received it, you could always sendit back. Even if you’re looking to purchase a car online, you can always have the owner driveover so you can inspect if before making a decision. A house, however, is a little more difficult todrive, so you’d have to go out to the home yourself to take a look.So, can you sell your home through the internet? Yes; it’s already happening. Should you expectsomeone to buy your home online sight unseen? I don’t think that’s going to happenanytime soon.If you have any questions about our internet savviness or which websites we use to markethomes, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.

What going to happen in 2019?” Here are some of my thoughts about the market for you to consider:      Interest rates are still amazingly low. When I bought my houses, interest rates were at 12.75%, which really puts into perspective how great our current 5% rate actually is. Compared to last year, however, rates are a whole point higher.        Houses are more expensive. Not only have interest rates risen, but home prices have gone up, as well. This is good news for sellers, but less so for buyers.  So what does the combination of these two factors mean to you as a seller? It means that if you price your property correctly according to the market and allow a good agent (like myself) to give it the proper exposure, it’s going to sell for top dollar.If you have any questions or would like more information about how I can help you sell your home for as much as possible, please reach out to me.

However, it doesn’t necessarily mean higher prices for you. Winter sales have a lotfewer houses, but still a steady supply of buyers. From what I’ve seen, winter sales tend to bringa little bit more money if you get in at the right time.        The market cycle. The market is cyclical, but we’re probably at the peak right now.
